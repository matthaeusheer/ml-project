# ml-project
Group project for Introduction to Machine Learning.


## Installation
Install the python dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How-Tos
In the following, please provide instructions on how to run things you wrote.

### Zip the code archive to submit for online project tool
Run
```bash
git archive --format=tar.gz HEAD -o data/code_archive.tar.gz
```

This will create a zipped tar ball in the data folder which can then be uploaded
to the project tool. 

### Task 0
Check out the notebooks/task_0.ipynb. Instructions are given in the notebook.

### Task 1
Check out the notebooks/task_1a.ipynb. Instructions are given in the notebook.  
Check out the notebooks/task_1b.ipynb. Instructions are given in the notebook.

### Task 2
Check out the notebooks/task2.ipynb. Instructions are given in the notebook.  

For this task, we have an additional notebook for the neural network approach. Since it
did note produce better result than our traditional approach, we did not use it for 
the prediction in the end. It is placed in notebooks/task2_tf.ipynb.
